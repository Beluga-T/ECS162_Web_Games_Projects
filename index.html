    /** Overview of the project:
    * This project is a simple web game arcade that contains four games: Hangman, Wordle, Classic Snake Game, and Tic
    Tac Toe.
    * The project is created for the course ECS 162 Web Programming at the University of California, Davis.
    * The project is created by Timothy Dare and Siwei Tan.

    we have created a simple web game arcade that contains four games: Hangman, Wordle, Classic Snake Game, and Tic Tac
    Toe.
    we maintained a consistent design style for the game icons and the overall layout of the website.
    The starry background use a canvas element to create a starry night sky effect. the stars are randomly generated and
    animated to create a twinkling effect.
    the size of the stars is related to the speed of the stars, which is determined by the size of the stars.
    the larger the stars, the slower they move up.
    All the icons and image assets are from Flaticon, and the links to the original icons are provided in the game and
    its shown right below the game icons.
