## Overview of the project
This project is a simple web game arcade featuring four games: Hangman, Wordle, Classic Snake Game, and Tic Tac Toe. It was created for the course ECS 162 Web Programming at the University of California, Davis by Timothy Dare and Siwei Tan.

The design maintains a consistent style across game icons and the overall layout. A starry night sky background, implemented using a canvas element, features randomly generated stars that twinkle and move. The size of the stars inversely affects their movement speed; larger stars move slower. All icons and image assets are sourced from Flaticon, with original icon links provided below each game icon.

Enhancements include:
- Addition of a starry night sky background to match the arcade theme.
- Color adjustments for the snake and food to align with the arcade's color scheme.
- A game over screen that displays the final score and high score, stored in localStorage.
- Mode buttons to adjust the snake's speed and the game's difficulty.
- Eliminate all the alert function

## Tic Tac Toe
Adapted from the Professor's source code, this version also includes the starry night sky background consistent with the arcade's theme.
